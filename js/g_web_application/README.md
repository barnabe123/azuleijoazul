Guide to run:

This is a guide to run on Ubuntu 18.04.

I created this web application called "Travel A'' that only register future travels of users using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

I stored in a Database using MySQL and PHP.

First of all, it's necessary for the installation Apache PHP 7.2 + MySQL and PHPMyAdmin.

After, you need to put all the files inside this path: /var/www/html

Now, go on Google Chrome and search for: localhost/form.html

Also, open another tab and paste this link: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/sql.php?server=1&db=form&table=form&pos=0&token=5b0acb2398d4f81e53eaf114b98bc596

The Username is: admin
The password is: admin4321

You are ready to run the application, fill all the information fields and you will be automatically redirected to the submitted page. After, you can look at the Database and see all this information stored.
